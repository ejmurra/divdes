  <h2>BLACK SCIENCE MATTERS</h2>
  <p>One afternoon during the fall 2014 semester at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I arrived early to one of my African-American studies classes. At a predominantly white institution like Illinois, where I am faced with being “other” at almost every turn, I look forward to the sense of community I feel during AFRO classes.</p>
  <p>Soon, a fellow black woman student whom I’ll call Mel walked in and sat beside me. Mel is nice, bubbly and bright. That day she was also upset and began to tell me about an experience she just had with her academic adviser.</p>
  <p>My friend aspires to be a physician, but she had mainly C’s in her molecular and cellular biology class, a prerequisite for medical school. Upon asking her adviser about her future as a pre-med student, Mel was met not only with pessimism but with what she felt was nonchalance and dismissiveness.“You need to do something else. Nobody wants to have a person in the medical field with C’s,” Mel said the adviser had told her. You need to go into African-American studies, I think you’re good at that.’”</p>
  <p>-----</p>
  <p>Underrepresented students at predominantly white institutions — especially students going into the science, technology, engineering or math fields — are too often reminded of the forces working against them in the pursuit of their goals.</p>
  <p>The demanding STEM curriculum is just one challenge underrepresented students face. Add to it unsupportive environments, discouraging microaggressions from peers, failed student pipelines and a dearth of financial resources and it is no wonder that representation in the STEM fields is so dismal.</p>
  <p>And it is just that — dismal. According to The Grio, an online division of MSNBC devoted to news of special interest to the African-American community, in 2009 African-Americans received only 1 percent of the degrees awarded nationally in science technologies and 4 percent of degrees in math and statistics. The percentage of total STEM degrees earned by blacks actually decreased from 8.1 percent in 2001 to 7.5 percent in 2009. For underrepresented students, the STEM field is a lonely one, a land barren of different voices and perspectives, a veritable desert of diversity.</p>
  <p>With the number of African-Americans in Illinois’ College of Engineering at about 2 percent — not even one-fifth of the national African-American population of 15 percent — a 2015 proposal by the university’s Engineering Graduate Student Advisory Committee concludes the university needs to step up itsinstitutional commitment to diversity.</p>
  <p>“Institutional commitment is critical because you can’t just depend on some sort of outside funding forever,” said Dr. Gary S. May, dean of the College of Engineering at Georgia Tech. He and other influential thinkers in the STEM field were quoted in the proposal.</p>
  <p>May said that short-term solutions seeking to increase diversity are ineffective. “You have to put some of the activities into the fabric of what the institutional mission is.”</p>
  <p>At Georgia Tech, May has created programs that attempt to increase the number of underrepresented students annually. One program provides graduate students fellowship supplements, workshops, seminars and grants to keep them both funded and motivated to progress through their degrees. Through the program, in a span of 15 years, 430 students from underrepresented groups have earned Ph.D.s, and 32 have gone on to become professors.</p>
  <p>The other program May initiated is a summer undergraduate research program for underrepresented students. It focuses on early engagement, another piece he believes to be critical in having underrepresented undergraduates go on to master’s and doctoral degrees.</p>
  <p>As an African-American, May is no stranger to the challenges of being a black student in a STEM field.“I was lonely,” he said in the committee’s proposal. “I think the underrepresentation is keenly felt by those of that are in the field, and you sort of wonder why there aren’t more people pursuing the same sort of amazing careers and what can you do to make a difference.”</p>
  <p>While administrative challenges are certainly part of the diversity problem, the proposal cited social climate as especially difficult for STEM students of color. Underrepresented students report that they are often overlooked when it comes to group assignments, that the significance of their contributions is diminished and that they are generally made to feel inferior to white peers.</p>
  <p>----</p>
  <p>So why do we need diversity in the sciences?</p>
  <p>“When you don’t consider all points of views, we don’t get the best answer,” May said. “The best example is voice activation. The first voice activation devices did not respond to female voices because there were no women on the design team. You can extend that any number of different directions, but that’s the basic idea.”</p>
  <p>In May 2015, Dr. Yemaya Bordain became the first black woman to earn a Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering at Illinois.</p>
  <p>“In the sciences and engineering, we solve problems,” Bordain wrote in a text message. “When it comes to using innovation to solve the world's most challenging problems, divergent thinkers are necessary. Without diversity, we are voluntarily missing the voices of those with unique perspectives that are criticalin the process of problem solving.”</p>
  <p>And yet, making sure that underrepresented students have equal access to STEM fields is more than just cultural pluralism.</p>
  <p>Underrepresented students in STEM bring more than their ethnicities to the table. I would venture to say that most black students in STEM are not going into STEM to become the “first black _____.” They are going into STEM because they love science. Or math. Or engineering. And they make brilliant contributions not because they are black, but because they are brilliant.</p>
  <p>Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, arguably one of the most visible scientists in the nation, frequently speaks on his experience of being a black man in the STEM field. In a 2008 interview with Dr. Thomas Cech, deGrasse Tyson related that his first speaking engagement on a news broadcast did not include him talking about his blackness, and that it was a revelation for him. He was asked to speak as an expert, not as a black expert.</p>
  <p>“Whatever is your next encounter with a black person — trying to squeegee your windshield at the red light [for example] — if you’re prone to saying, ‘Oh these black people, they don’t work, they’re too dumb,’ you’re going to have to remember that I just told you that Earth is safe from the plasma that came from the sun! You’re going to have to reconcile this. You’re going to have wonder ‘Oh maybe this guy could have been one of those,’ but for lack of opportunity. But for lack of institutions with foresight,” deGrasse Tyson said.</p>
  <p>Shareefah Williams, a University of Illinois computer science major, puts it this way: “They need us. Just as much as every other race or culture.”</p>
  <p>This point is powerful and telling. We don’t need diversity for the quotas. We do not even need diversity for the sake of diversity. We need diversity in the sciences because the sciences need us.</p>
